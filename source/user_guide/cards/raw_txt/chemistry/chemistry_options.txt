 defined in the database.

 transport constraints, basis swapping, etc.).

IMMOBILE_SPECIES
 List of immobile species that are included as primary dependent variables
 (e.g. biomass, NAPL, customization in the reaction sandbox).

:ref:`mineral-kinetics-card`
 Parameters for kinetic mineral precipitation/dissolution reactions.

:ref:`sorption-card`
 Sorption reactions.

:ref:`reaction-sandbox-card`
  Reaction sandbox for custom, user-defined reactions.

DATABASE <string>
 Path/filename for reaction database.  For descriptions of the database format, see the brief :ref:`geochemical-database`, or :ref:`thermodynamic-database`, a more indepth description from the theory guide.

LOG_FORMULATION
 Flag for solving Newton-Raphson equations with derivatives computed with 
 respect to the logarithm  (base 10) of the concentrations. Should not be
 used for linear equations (e.g. conservative tracers).

ACTIVITY_COEFFICIENTS <algorithm string> <frequency string>
 Specifies algorithms for calculating activity coefficients. 
 (default = LAG TIMESTEP)

 - Algorithm:

  - OFF:
     Disables the calculation of activity coefficients. All activity 
     coefficients are assume to be 1.
  - LAG: 
     The update of activity coefficients is lagged by a 
     TIMESTEP or NEWTON_ITERATION.
  - NEWTON
     Ionic strength and activity coefficient calculation iterates to
     convergence. **Computationally expensive.**

 - Update Frequency:

  - TIMESTEP
     Update after every time step
  - NEWTON_ITERATION
     Update after every Newton iteration

NO_CHECK_UPDATE
 @EXPERT
 Disables (pre)check on solution update.

NO_BDOT
 Use Debye-Huckel formulation without B-dot.

NO_RESTART_MINERAL_VOL_FRAC
 Disables the reading of mineral volume fractions on restart. Mineral
 volume fractions specified in the input file will be used instead.

NO_CHECKPOINT_ACT_COEFS
 Disables checkpointing of activity coefficients. Since activity
 coefficients are a function of the solution ionic strength from the 
 previous time step, the original and restarted solutions will not 
 match identically if such checkpointing is disabled.

UPDATE_POROSITY
 Update porosity after every time step.  The default minimum porosity is 0,
 and one can make minimum porosity non-zero using MINIMUM_POROSITY.
 The initial porosity is calculated as a function of initial mineral volume
 fractions.
 See :ref:`material-property-updates` in the :ref:`theory-guide`.

MINIMUM_POROSITY <float>
 Float specifies minimum porosity to which porosity is truncated if
 below that value. (default = 0)

UPDATE_PERMEABILITY
 Update permeabilty after every time step.
 See :ref:`material-property-updates` in the :ref:`theory-guide`.

UPDATE_TORTUOSITY
 Update tortuosity after every time step.
 See :ref:`material-property-updates` in the :ref:`theory-guide`.

MOLAL, MOLALITY
 Print concentrations as molalities instead of molarities.

ACTIVITY_H2O, ACTIVITY_WATER
 Calculate activity of water.
 (default = False)

:ref:`output-chemistry-card`
 Specifies parameters for output.

MAX_DLNC <float>
 Specifies maximum change in log concentration for a Newton Raphson iteration.  
 Changes in concentration larger than this value will be truncated to this 
 value.  
 (default = 5)

MAX_RELATIVE_CHANGE_TOLERANCE <float>
 Specifies the maximum relative change in free ion concentration allowed for 
 convergence (i.e. ||(c^k+1-c^k)/c^k||_inf).  
 (default = 1.e-12)

MAX_RESIDUAL_TOLERANCE <float>
 Specified the maximum residual allowed for a primary species for convergence 
 (i.e. ||f(c^k+1)||_inf).  
 (default = 1.e-12)

TRUNCATE_CONCENTRATION <float>
 Specify a minimum concentration below which free-ion concentration may not 
 fall.  (Due to the molality/molarity conversion, the concentration may fall 
 slightly below the prescribed value when the water density is less than 1000 
 kg/m\ :sup:`3`\)
 
USE_FULL_GEOCHEMISTRY
 Forces full geochemistry calculation even if only tracers are specified. 

GEOTHERMAL_HPT
 @EXPERT
 Turns on the geothermal high pressure-temperature capability.

ELECTRICAL_CONDUCTIVITY_METHOD
 Specifies the method used to calculate fluid electrical conductivity 
 (e.g., for use in output, geophysics, etc.). Options include: LINEAR, 
 PSEUDO_LINEAR, MOBILITY.
